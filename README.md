# MVVM with Rx-Swift

It's a simple demo project for the in house talk on MVVM with RxSwift. It consist of a single Login ViewController.
In this talk I have covered the following topics 
- What are Massive ViewControllers
- How MVVM solve this Massive ViewControllers problem
- How MVVM and RxSwift works together

The project contains three branches. 
- Master : Has the final code with Rx
- with-rx : Has the MVVM implementation with Rx
- without-rx : Has the MVVM implementation without Rx
